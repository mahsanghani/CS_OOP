/* What is an Interface ?
*  A language construct that is similar to a class (in terms of syntax) but is fundamentally different
*  
*  Why ?
*      To build loosely-coupled applications
*      
*      intertfaces and Testability
*      interfaces and Extensibily
*      interfaces are NOT for multiple inheritance
*      interfaces and polymorphism
*
